Skin diseases that will be included in the dataset:

1. Acne Vulgaris
    Common: One of the most prevalent skin conditions, especially among teenagers and young adults. 
    It includes pimples, blackheads, and cysts, mostly on the face, back, and shoulders.

2. Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis)
    Common: A chronic condition that causes itchy, inflamed skin. Common in children but can occur 
    at any age. Often triggers include allergens, stress, or harsh weather.

3. Psoriasis
    Common: An autoimmune disease causing rapid skin cell turnover, leading to thick, scaly patches.
    It's often seen on the elbows, knees, and scalp.

4. Seborrheic Dermatitis
    Common: A chronic condition that causes scaly, red skin, typically on the scalp, face, and upper 
    chest. It's often mistaken for dandruff or acne.

5. Lichen Planus:
    Moderate: An inflammatory condition that results in purple, itchy, flat-topped bumps, often on the 
    wrists, lower back, or inside the mouth.

6. Vitiligo:
    Moderate: A condition that causes loss of skin pigment, leading to irregular, white patches of skin.
    It can affect any area of the body.

7. Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)
    Rare: The most common type of skin cancer, but often not aggressive. BCC typically appears as a small,
    pearly bump or growth, often on sun-exposed areas like the face, ears, and neck.

8. Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)
    Rare: The second most common form of skin cancer. SCC often appears as a firm, red nodule or a scaly 
    patch that may bleed or ulcerate, commonly on areas of the skin exposed to the sun.

9. Melanoma
    Rare: The most dangerous form of skin cancer. Melanoma usually appears as a new mole or changes in an 
    existing mole. It can spread rapidly, so early detection is crucial.

10. Dermatofibroma
    Rare:
